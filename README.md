# Sinatra Heroku Boilerplate #

## Is it any good? ##
Yes. Maybe. If you're looking for a full-featured boilerplate, then
bummer. This is pretty bare-bones. I'd love to flesh it out more, but
don't know what I want to add at this point, so you're stuck with what I
hope is a lightweight, easy to use boilerplate. I made this because I'm
too lazy to spend what probably amount to 2.3 minutes creating all this
the old-fashioned way. And I thought I could use the practice.
